	I have an request to get some data and add it to a variable,

	When I use:

	.then(function(response) {
		this.persons = response.data;
	});
	It does not assign response.data to this.persons but when I do the following:

	.then(response => this.persons = response.data);
	It assigns it fine to use. Please see the js fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/trhhtyxr/2/



	As I have explained it here, arrow syntax does not bind it's own this, arguments, super, or new.target. Arrow functions are always anonymous. These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions.

	Scope of this changes inside a function() block and it does not refer to the currently executing function, while with arrow function, this refers to the currently executing function only.
